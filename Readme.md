## Description
This project automates Instagram activities such as following, unfollowing, and identifying potential users to connect with based on activity data. It uses `SeleniumBase` for browser automation, processes data with `BeautifulSoup`, and handles JSON and CSV files for efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Features
- **Unfollow Users**: Identifies and unfollows users who donâ€™t follow back.
- **Follow Users**: Sends follow requests to selected Instagram users.
- **CSV Data Storage**: Logs potential connections and interactions for future analysis.
- **Cookie Management**: Reuses session cookies for a seamless user experience.

### Challenges Faced
- Handling diverse JSON structures in Instagram data exports.
- Maintaining realistic delays to avoid triggering anti-bot measures.
- Managing browser automation across varying Instagram post layouts.
